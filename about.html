        fulfilling workplaces by rethinking a lot of traditional practices.

          We want to build a different type of company that’s focused not only
          on the bottom line, but also the happiness of our customers and team,
          and our personal growth along the journey. Here are the values that
          collectively guide our decisions and actions:

                authenticity and honesty.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a team, we view transparency as an effective way to work

              <li>
